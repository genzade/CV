<!-- Confident, articulate and highly driven junior web developer seeking a position as a junior developer. Having recently completed a 12 week intensive course in full stack web development. 

I am not just looking for a role as web developmer as much as I am a place I can fulfill my desire to learn and continue my journey as a programmer.

found true calling
- i enjoy what i do, i have had too many menial jobs where i not only did not enjoy myself but also did not feel i was adding any value whatsoever -->

As a person who has finally found my true calling in life (very cliche, I know, but it's true) in programming, I have awoken a passion that I had no idea existed within me. I have had too many menial jobs where I not only did not enjoy what I was doing for a living but also did not feel I was adding any value whatsoever. Now I know what I want. Having completed a bootcamp in coding I have recaptured a feeling I havent had since I was a 12 year old kid walking into a comic book shop for the first time; one of passion, excitement and the overwelming desire to consume absolutely everything I can get my hands on. Having entered this world, I am not just looking for a role as web developmer as much as I am a place I can fulfill my desire to learn and continue my journey as a programmer. PS Batman Rocks.

## Education


#### Queen Mary and Westfield College (2008 to 2011)

- BEng Mechanical Engineering
- Grade: Not the best in the world
- I learnt how much I am capable of learning when I have no passion for the topic so I decided to search for something I find for engaging (spoiler alert: I found it)

#### Makers Academy (2015 to 2016)

- Curiosity and hungry passion for code
- Independent learner and problem-solver
- OOP, TDD, SOLID, MVC, DDD
- Software Craftsmanship
- Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Node.js, Angular.js
- Rspec, Jasmine, Mocha
- the most imprtant thing I learnt from Makers Academy is how to think like a programmer and debugging, and that, coupled with my affinity for problem solving, I find most fulfilling (and genuinely enjoyable)
