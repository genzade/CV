<!-- Confident, articulate and highly driven junior web developer seeking a position as a junior developer. Having recently completed a 12 week intensive course in full stack web development. 

I am not just looking for a role as web developmer as much as I am a place I can fulfill my desire to learn and continue my journey as a programmer.

found true calling
- i enjoy what i do, i have had too many menial jobs where i not only did not enjoy myself but also did not feel i was adding any value whatsoever -->

As a person who has finally found my calling in life in programming (very cliche, I know, but it's true!), I have found my passion. After too many menial jobs that have had no meaningful impact in the world, I am looking forward to a career adding value. I now know what I want. 

Having just completed a coding bootcamp, I have recaptured a feeling I haven't had since being a 12 year old kid walking into a comic book shop for the first time; one of passion, excitement and the overwhelming desire to learn and absorb absolutely everything I can get my hands on. I am not just looking for a role as web developer: I am looking for a place I can fulfil my desire to learn and continue my journey as a developer. 

P.S. Batman rocks.
