As a person who has finally found my calling in life in programming (very cliche, I know, but it's true!), I have found my passion. After too many menial jobs that have had no meaningful impact in the world, I am looking forward to a career adding value. I now know what I want. 

Having just completed a coding bootcamp, I have recaptured a feeling I haven't had since being a 12 year old kid walking into a comic book shop for the first time; one of passion, excitement and the overwhelming desire to learn and absorb absolutely everything I can get my hands on. I am not just looking for a role as web developer: I am looking for a place I can fulfil my desire to learn and continue my journey as a developer. 

P.S. Batman rocks. I know you didn't ask, but it does, and should, go without saying.

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

### Problem solving
- I am used to breaking down and solving complex problems as that is a process I am already familiar with from Maths.
- Mechanical engineering taught me how to approach problems. I particularly enjoy the mathematical side of engineering - formulas and their derivations, applying them to real world situations.

### Resourcefulness
- I grew Ethnic Mind from a team of 3 people to managing 22, taking them from meeting in coffee shops and hotel lobbies to working from a startup accelerator office space.

### Patience
- A virtue I developed through a number of customer service based roles I have taken up over the years. I am adamant that you will not feel my pain until you know what it is like to work as a sales assistant in a kids shoe department during a sale.
